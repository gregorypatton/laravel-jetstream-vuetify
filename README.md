Welcome to the Laravel Jetstream, Inertia, Tailwind CSS, and Vuetify Starter Template! This project provides a solid foundation for building modern web applications with Laravel on the backend and Inertia.js for server-side rendering on the frontend, styled using Tailwind CSS and Vuetify.

## Introduction
